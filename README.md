# Fun With Words - Java Edition

Welcome to **Fun With Words**, an interactive and fun Java console game where YOU create hilarious and surprising stories by filling in the blanks!

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This is my very first Java project — a creative twist on the classic Mad Libs word game, developed in Java. It invites users to enter adjectives, nouns, and verbs, then generates a personalized story filled with unexpected and amusing moments.

I’ve enhanced the basic tutorial version by adding:

- A longer, immersive story  
- Personalized player experience  
- Engaging output formatting with emojis  
- Fun facts about animals to keep you curious!  

It’s perfect for Java beginners to learn console input, string manipulation, and randomization — all while having a blast!

---

## 🖥️ Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher installed  
- Any Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code) or command line setup

---

## 🚀 How to Play

1. Run the `Main.java` file in your Java IDE or compiler.  
2. Enter the words prompted on screen (adjectives, nouns, verbs, and your name).  
3. Enjoy your customized, laugh-out-loud story!

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- Handling user input with `Scanner`
